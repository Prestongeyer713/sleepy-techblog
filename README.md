# sleepy-techblog
this application was designed to give sleepy coders an outlet to express there frustrations and ask for help.
It utilizes dotenv, express, and mysql.
when you first open the app it will ask you to log in, or signup.
once you do you'll have acess to all the blog posts in the library.
from there you can comment, and upvote.
unfortunately I had some trouble getting the post function to work and ran out of time trying to fix it. 
I hope to look back on this project and finish it up when i have a better understanding of coding.
